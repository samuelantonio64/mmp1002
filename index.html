<H1> The Gray Room </H1>
	<p> You wake up. Your in a room with monicrome colors. You dont know where you are or how you got there. But you probably shoulnt stay here. Infront of you is a door slightly opened, on your left is a vent, and behind you is a door that shows nothing but darkness and can feel colder the closer you get to it.</p>
